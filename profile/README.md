## ❓ FAQ

**Q1: Does the Mod Menu affect multiplayer?**
No. It’s restricted to single-player sessions to prevent online interference.

**Q2: Can I disable features after enabling them?**
Absolutely — use the same toggle keys or restore defaults via `reset.cfg`.

**Q3: Is it safe for save files?**
Yes. The tool creates automatic backups before applying any modification.

**Q4: How do I update the Mod Menu?**
The menu checks for newer builds on startup and notifies you of available updates.

Use the **Safe Mode** launch argument:

This disables advanced shaders temporarily.
